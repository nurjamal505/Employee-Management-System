### README.md for Employee Management System

# Employee Management System

## Project Description
The **Employee Management System** is a JavaFX application that helps users manage employee details and calculate their salaries. The system is designed using OOP principles with an abstract `Employee` class and its subclasses: `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`, and `Contractor`. Users can:
- Add employees to the system.
- View a list of employees in a table.
- Calculate and update salaries dynamically.
- Remove employees from the table.

This project uses JavaFX's `TableView` for displaying data and provides a clean, user-friendly GUI built with SceneBuilder.

---

## Features
- Add employees with specific details: name, type (Full-Time, Part-Time, Contractor), hourly rates, hours worked, etc.
- Automatically calculate salaries based on the employee type and input details.
- Display employee data in a table format.
- Update and remove employees easily.
- Validation to ensure valid input (e.g., non-negative hours and positive rates).
